Stochastic Canine C code
========================

Files in this distribution implement a stochastic model of Canine ventricular myocyte,
described by Greenstein and Winslow Biophys J 2002; 106:1288-93. This code was not used
to run simulations described in the paper, but should produce similar results.

This code is the first released version of stochastic Canine model written in C and MPI, 
and considered beta. It has not been tested throroughly, so bug may persist. Nevertheless, 
the code should perform well.

More documentation can be found from directory 'Documentation'. 

To get better understanding of the model, please see thesis of Joseph Greenstein (it can be 
found from www.ccbm.jhu.edu) or article Greenstein, J. and Winslow, R. L.(2002)
