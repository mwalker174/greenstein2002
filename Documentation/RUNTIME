Runtimes
========

Runtimes observed on IBM p690 with 6 processors for one second of simulation
were (without use of dynamic FRU number)

	FRU#	Time (s)
	  125	  83
	  250    113	 
	  500    180
	 1250    390
	 2500    740
	12500   3600

This code is not optimized for small simulations, so time for eg 125 FRUs could be 
improved. To get realistic results, at least 1250 FRUs should be used, depending 
on the aims of simulations. The full model is 12500 FRUs, since that is the assumed 
number of available functional release units in a real canine ventricular myocyte.
