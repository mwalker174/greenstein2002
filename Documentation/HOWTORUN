HOW TO RUN
==========

This code is best to be run with MPI, although it does run without MPI.
To compile code, appropriate modifications to Makefile should be made.
The default Makefile should compile and run in IBM AIX with xlc compiler.

To run the code in IBM AIX with MPI, first compile the code with 'make'. Then
add a host.list file containing list of MPI hosts, and check .rhosts. 
To run the code with 6 processes the command is

	poe ./stoch -procs 6

The code has been tested on IBM AIX (xlc) and Windows (Visual C++ .NET). 
The code is known to work with 48 processors, but it should too run well 
on one processor.

File 'parameters.h' contains most tunable parameters for the model. There 
are controls for length of simulation, desired accuracy of numerical integration,
voltage clamp etc.

Once the code has run, it produces files states.txt, otherstates.txt and
currents.txt describing results. The files contain descriptive headers.
